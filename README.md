# Star Wars GraphQL spark

This repository is a tutorial about graphQL implementation with spark. For more useful links visit [graphql-server-java-samples](https://github.com/DavidNowakowski/graphql-server-java-samples)

This application is going to follow the common controller-service-repository architecture. We want to focus specially on the graphQL implementation so the repository and service layer will be already coded.

This project contains branches which allows us to continue the tutorial each step. Each branch branch it is called as index entries. Please checkout on each step to these branches as there are updates on the code on other layers not related directly with graphQL. To start the tutorial checkout branch called gettingstarted.
